# Multithreading - Forks (Lab 4)


### 1. Message From Threads

In this, we create a child thread using the `fork` construct, and display different messages from the two threads.


### 2. Thread ID's

In this, we use the `fork` construct to spin off multiple threads at different positions in the code, and observe the order in which they are executed (there is no definite order), and also the thread's id and the id of its parent thread.
