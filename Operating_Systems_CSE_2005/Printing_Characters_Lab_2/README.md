# Printing Characters (Lab 2)

In this lab, we use the c language to create an image to print a character to the screen.

Note that there are two versions of codes available with this directory for this solution, and thy have just minor changes in their code.


Note : We also have an empty assembly program which can be used to form an image which effectively does nothing, but this is a blueprint whith the middle portion left blank for us to fill with the code for the scenarios we will be facing in the labs further.
