# Investigating NTFS / FAT/ Linux drives (Lab 8)


Download an evaluation version of a tool for exploring disk drives such as DiskExplorer from 
* https://www.runtime.org/diskexplorer.htm

It is available for NTFS, FAT and Linux. 

Use the tool to investigate your NTFS drive and conduct your data recovery, using the following features: 

Navigate your NTFS drive by jumping to the partition table, boot record, Master file table or the root directory. 

Choose between views such as hex, text, index allocation, MFT, boot record, partition table. 

Inspect the file entry details, NT attributes etc. 

Search your drive for text, partition tables, boot records, MFT entries, and index buffers.

Do a similar exercise for FAT and Linux drives.
