# Digital Forensics - CSE4004


## Setup

The setup procedure followed here is a Windows 7 Professional edition with a list of tools installed which have been stated within the corresponding lab directory. This Operating system in my case is run inside a virtual box environment. You can do the same process, or follow any other version of the Windows operating system.

There are also certain virtual machines available which can be used for a maximum of 90 days, and depending on the version they can be renewed for another term too.

## List of Programs

#### 1. [Lab 1](./Lab_1)

We here deal with the concept of hashing text, files of different formats using various hashing algorithms, their properties, and also the general necessary qualifications and qualities of a good hash function, and also we have seen what makes a hash function have collisions. We also demonstrate a hash collision of the `MD5` hashing algorithm.

#### 2. [Lab 2](./Lab_2)

We have in this experiment, analysed directories on the hard disk using `Microsoft’s Log Parser Tool`, and performed tasks like knowing the top 10 largest or smallest files in a directory, etc.
