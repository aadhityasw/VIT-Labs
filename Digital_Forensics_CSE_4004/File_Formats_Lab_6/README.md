# Identifying file types (Lab 6)

Forensics investigators often encounter file types that are not known to them. They have to be careful since even though a file has a particular extension it does not mean that is the true format of the file.

For the following file extensions identify the type of files e.g. image file, audio file, text file etc. and include a brief description. Neatly classify them.
