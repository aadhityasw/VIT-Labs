# Open MP - Exploring Constructs (Lab 2)

The first program deals with finding the factorial of multiple numbers simpltaneously, this can be extended to understand how multiple instances of a function can be executed in parallel.

<br>

The second program deals with exploring the `single construct` in openmp, this is a section which gets executed by only one thread, while the others skip this section.

<br>

The third program expands on the array sum program dealt in the previous lab, here we have print statements to better understand the flow of the program and how the addition takes place among the threads while it maintains the overall sum and displays it in the end.

<br>

The fourth program is a more advanced usage of the open mp constructs, as we build a matrix multiplication program which has been parallelized for better performance. We use multiple such constructs, and also provide options to compare the runtime between a parallized version and a standard version run using a single thread.

The fifth program deals with exploring the `sections construct` in openmp, this is used to execute multiple sets of code in parallel.
