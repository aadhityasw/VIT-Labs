# Open MP - Introduction (Lab 1)

In this lab, we do two programs, we start with a simple hello world program where we print a line of text from multiple threads that are executed in parallel.

In the second part, we use multiple threads to find the sum of elements of an array. Note that this is done in parallel, and is thus faster than the standard version with a single thread.
