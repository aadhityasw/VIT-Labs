# MPI Applications - Airplane Seating Arrangement (Lab 9)

This lab addresses the following situation : 

<br>

20 people line up to board an airplane. Each has a boarding pass with assigned seat. However, the first person to board has lost his boarding pass and takes a random seat. After that, each person takes the assigned seat if it is unoccupied, and one of unoccupied seats at random otherwise. Write an efficient MPI program with 2 distributed nodes to calculate the percentage of people who occupied their assigned seats and percentage of people who occupied seats randomly.
