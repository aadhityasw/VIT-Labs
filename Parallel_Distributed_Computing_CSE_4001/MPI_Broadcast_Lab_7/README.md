# MPI - Broadcast (Lab 7)

In this lab session, we will dive into MPI, and mainly focus on Broadcasting a message from one process to another. For our current case, we will consider one thread which finds the sum of elements of an array and then broadcasts this sum to all other processes which then updates their own value with the modified version.
