# MPI - Introduction (Lab 5)

We start the first program with a hello world program with MPI, to get to know the basic syntax to be followed with this constructs.

In the second program, we begin the core function of MPI, message passing. We pass messages from one process to another demonstrating interprocess communication.

In the final program of this lab, we use various constructs of MPI, to understand the connection data of the various processors involved in the communication channel.
