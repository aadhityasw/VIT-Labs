# Open MP Producer-Consumer Construct (Lab 4)

* The first program solves the question stated below :

<i>Use OpenMP to implement a producer-consumer program in which
some of the threads are producers and others are consumers. The
producers read text from a collection of files, one per producer. They
insert lines of text into a single shared queue. The consumers take the
lines of text and tokenize them. Tokens are “words”.</i>

* The second program solves the question stated below :

<i> A search engine can be implemented using a farm of servers; each contains a subset of data that can be searched. Assume that this farm server has a single front-end that interacts with clients who submit queries. Implement the above server form using master-worker pattern. </i>
