# Open MP - Barriers & Reductions (Lab 3)

In the first program, we use Open MP to parallelize the task of swapping the elements of two arrays.

<br>

In the second program, we further build upon the task of finding the sum of elements of array, this time using reductions which are a useful utility in the Open MP catalogue.

<br>

We explore the use of the Barrier Construct of Open MP in the third program.

<br>

In the fourth and the final portion, we form a better performing matrix multiplication program this time using the power of barriers, we have compared the runtime of this new version with the previous parallel version.
