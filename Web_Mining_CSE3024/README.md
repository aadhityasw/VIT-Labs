# Web Mining CSE3014


## List of Programs

#### 1. [Web Crawlers](./Web_Crawlers_Lab_1)

In this we use the Beautiful soap library to develop crawlers with basic functions.

#### 2. [Inverted Indexing](./Inverted_Indexing_Lab_2)

We perform a tf-idf indexing of documents crawled from the web.

#### 3. [Naive Bayes](./Naive_Bayes_Lab_3)

We perform a Naive Bayes Classifier on a set of document frequencies.

#### 4. [Selenium Introduction](./Selenium_Extract_Contact_Lab_4)

We write a program to extract contact details from a website and save it in files.

#### 5. [Index Compression](./Index_Compression_Lab_5)

We construct an inverted index to a set of 3 documents and also perform index compression.

#### 6. [Page Ranking](./Page_Ranking_Lab_6)

We build a page ranking algorithm using the networkX library, and then validate the results by implementing the same using Random Walk Method.

#### 7. [HITS Algorithm](./HITS_Algorithm_Lab_7)

We build a HITS algorithm for ranking and indexing pages across the web.

#### 8. [Decision Tree](./Decision_Tree_Lab_8)

We build a `ID3` and a `CART` decision trees, after exploring the `Cleveland Heart Disease` Dataset from the UCI Repository.

#### 9. [Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier](./Multinomial_NB_Lab_9)

We build a `Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier` for classifying tweets based on their sentiments, after exploring the `US Airlines Twitter Sentiment Dataset` from kaggle.

#### 10. [K - Means Clustering](./K_Means_Lab_10)

We build a `K Means Clustering` Model for clustering movie reviews based on the text content, after exploring the `IMDB 50k Movie Review Dataset` from kaggle.

#### 11. [Agglomerative Clustering](./Agglomerative_Lab_10)

We build a `Agglomerative Clustering` Model for clustering Credit Card Fraud detection based on the transactions, after exploring the `Credit Card Fraud Dataset` from kaggle.

#### 12. [Apriori - Associated Rule Mining](./Apriori_Lab_11)

We build a `Apriori - Associated Rule Mining` Model for finding the most frequent clicked upon site based on clickstream data, after exploring the `Hungarian Newssite Clickstream Dataset`.
