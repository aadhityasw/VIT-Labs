## Contributing Guidelines


In case you want to start contributing to this repository, irrespective of it being a small change (even a small spelling mistake is welcome :) ) or a big one to the extent of adding a new course, you are welcome.

There are some steps which are needed to be followed in order to push a commit to this repository.

1. `Fork` this repository to your own account.
2. Make your necessary changes in your own forked version (`clone` if needed), and `commit` them to your fork.
3. Create a `Pull Request` from your forked version of your repo, to the base repository handled by @aadhityasw.
4. @aadhityasw will then review the commit and either recommend changes or accept it and merge it with the base repository and then your changes will be visible in the main branch. :)

I have highlighed a few key terms in the above steps which might sound daunting if you are new to `git` and `github`. I might update this with a detailed version explaining those terms and the steps in more detail. Until then feel free to search them up and understand them.

In case of any doubts, feel free to contact me.
