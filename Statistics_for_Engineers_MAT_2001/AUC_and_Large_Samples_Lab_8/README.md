# Area Under Curve and Large Samples (Lab 8)



### 1. [AUC Problems](./auc_problems.r)

Problem 1 : Plotting a function

Problem 2 : find the area to the left of 1

Problem 3 : find the area to the right of 1

Problem 4 : find the P(30< X <70) with mean=50 and sd=10

Problem 5 : Qnorm


### 2. [Cable Manufacturing](./cable_mannufacturing.r)

The mean breaking strength of the cables supplied by a manufacturer is 1800 with a sd=100.By a new technique in the manufacturing process, it is claimed that the breaking strength of the cable has increased. To test this claim, a sample of 50 cables is tested and found that the mean breaking strength s 1850. Can we support the claim of 5% LOS?


### 3. [Penguin Weights](./penguin_weights.r)

Suppose the mean weight of king penguins found in an artic last year was 15.4kg. In a sample of 35 penguins same time this year in the same colony, the mean penguin weight was 14.6kg. Assume the population sd=2.5kg. At 0.05 significance level reject the null hypothesis that the mean penguin weight does not differ from last year.
