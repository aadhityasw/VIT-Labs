# F test and Chi Squared Test (Lab 10)


### 1. [Material Weights](./material_weights.r)

Five measurements of the output of two units have given the following results(in kg of material per one hour of operation). Assume that both samples have been obtained from actual population, test at 10%  significance  level if two population have same variance.<br>
H0 : S1^2 = S2^2<br>
H1 : S1^2 != S2^2



### 2. [Nitrogen Yield](./nitrogen_yield.r)

In order to compare two sources of nitrogen namely ammonium chloride and urea on grain yield of paddy, An Experiment was conducted, the results of the gain in yield of paddy under the two treatment are given below<br>
Chloride : 13.4, 10.9, 11.2, 11.8, 14.0, 15.3, 14.2, 12.6, 17.0, 16.2, 16.5, 15.7<br>
Urea : 12.0, 11.7, 10.7, 11.2, 14.8, 14.4, 13.9, 13.7, 16.9, 16.0, 15.6, 16.0<br>
Which source of nitrogen has better yield?



### 3. [Students](./students.r)


Chi square Test Aim : To test if there is any association between the attributes, independence of attributes and goodness of fit.

Problem 1 : The  below table gives the distribution of students according to the family type and the anxiety level :


**Family Type \ Anxiety Levels**        Low         Normal      High<br>
Joint                               35          42          61<br>
Nuclear                             48          51          68
