# Normal Distributions (Lab 7)


### 1. [Sequence of numbers between -10 and 10 incrementing by 0.1](./sequence_1.r)

Create a sequence of numbers between -10 and 10 incrementing by 0.1. Let the mean be 2.5 and deviation be 0.5 visualize the normal curve for the above sequence. Also find its cumulative distribution function.


### 2. [Sequence of 200 numbers with x=-3 to 3](./sequence_2.r)

To create a sequence of 200 numbers with x=-3 to 3 for standard normal pdf with mean=0 and sd=1, and visualize the normal curve.
