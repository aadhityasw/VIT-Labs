# Applications (Lab 4) 



### 1. [Triangle Area with sides](./side_area.py)

Write a Python program, which reads a, b and c, as sides of a triangle and prints area. Hint: area =formula . [Hint: formula is (a+b+c)/2] [sqrt(x) will find square root]. Input 5  7  10 output 16.24.


### 2. [Distance](./distance.py)

Write a Python program, which reads a, b, c, d and e and prints the distance between point (a,b) and line cx+dy+e=0. [Hint: (ac+bd+e)/(c2+d2)1/2.] input 6 7 3 4 2 and its output 9.6.


### 3. [Triangle Area with points](./pt_area.py)

Write a Python program, which reads 6 numbers a, b, c, d, e and f. The program outputs the area of the triangle whose endpoints are (a,b), (c,d) and (e,f). [Hint: use above two questions]. Input 7  3  11  3  7  6 and its output 6.


### 4. [Line Intersection](./line_intersection.py)

Write program, which reads a, b, c, p, q and r. Let  ax + by + c = 0  and px + qy + r = 0 be equations of lines. Print their point of intersection. Input 4 8 12 2 7 3 and its output (5,1).


### 5. [Triangle Radian](./radian.py)

Write a Python program, which reads a, b and c, as sides of a triangle and prints the angle A in degree and radian. Hint: a2 = b2 +  c2 – 2bcCOS(A).  [Hint: use acos. Example: input 13, 12, 5 and its output 90.


### 6. [Right angled triangle](./right_triangle.py)

Write a Python program, which reads a, b and c as sides of a triangle and prints whether angle A is 900 or not. [Hint: if (a2 = b2+c2) ] [Do not use cos1 etc.] 


### 7. [Largest number](./largest_num.py)

Write a Python program, which reads three numbers and prints the biggest. 


### 8. [Range of Digits](./digit_range.py)

Given a three digit number, write an algorithm and Python code to find the range of last one, last two and last three digits of the number. If last one digit is greater than or equal to 5 then print 'Greater one digit' and 'Lesser one digit', if the last two digits are greater than or equal to 50 then print 'Greater two digits' or 'Lesser two digits'. If the three digits is greater than or equal to 500 print 'Greater three digits' or 'Lesser three digits'

For example, if the number is 673 then the output should beLesser one digitGreater two digits
Greater three digits

Input Format

First line contains the number, n

Output Format

First line contains range of last one digit
Second line cotains range of last two digits
Third line contains range of last three digits




### 9. [Cell Multiplication](./Call_Multiplication.py)


A hypothetical organism has got initially 'x' cells in the body. And the number of cells gets mutiplied by 8 for every 3 minutes. Given the initial number of cells 'x' in the body of the organism and the value of 'n', write an algoithm and Python code to determine the total number of cells in the body of the organism after 'n' minutes. For example, if the organism contains 5 cells intially after 10 minutes it will have 2560 cells. And the organism can live only for 50 minutes. Therefore if the value of 'n' is greater than 50 then print 'Invalid input'
Note: Don't use multiplication operator in the code


Input Format

First line contains the number of cells in the body of the organism, x
Second line contains the number of minutes, n


Output Format

Print either Invalid input or number of cells in the body of the organism
