# Java - Generics and FX (Lab 10)

## 1. Print Arrays

Generic methods are a very efficient way to handle multiple datatypes using a single method. 
Let's say you have an integer array and a string array. You have to write a single method printArray that can print all the elements of both arrays. The method should be able to accept both integer arrays or string arrays. Do not use method overloading.

Sample output:
1
2
3
Hello
World
