# Java - Introduction (Lab 1)

In this lab we will explore Data structures and Algorithms by solving two problems using the experience with Java Programming

## Digit Sum Prime Numbers

Find the count of all numbers from 1000 to 2000 whose sum of digits is prime.

## Hamiltonian Paths

Given a Graph Data Structure, write a program to find all the Hamiltonian paths in the graph.
