## 1. Divisors

Find the integer that has the largest number of divisors and print the number of divisors for numbers in the range 1 to 100000. Use threads to solve this problem.


## 2. Sieve of Eratosthenes

Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm finds all prime numbers less than ‘n’ when ‘n’ is very large. The algorithm is given below.
Algorithm:
Create a list of natural numbers

    Set k=2, the first unmarked number on the list Repeatedly do for k < sqrt (n)
        a. Mark all multiples of k in the natural numbers list.
        b. Find the next prime number i.e., the unmarked one and set it as k.

The unmarked numbers are primes.


## 3. Producer Consumer problem


Recall the producer consumer problem you studied in operating systems. Solve it using the multi threading concepts.
