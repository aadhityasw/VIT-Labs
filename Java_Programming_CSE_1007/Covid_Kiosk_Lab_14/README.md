# Java FX - Covid Kiosk (Lab 14)

Refer to the [Problem Statement](./Problem_Statement.pdf) file for more instructions.


There are two java projects attached with this lab, they are titled as 'COVID` and `Beta`.

The project titled `covid` works with all UI Functionalities, but has no database connectivity.

The project titled `beta` is just a beta version with JDBC connectivity for the states for maintaining a count of the cases. I believe there is more work to be done for this version and is thus incomplete and might not function properly.
This beta version is also not completely my work, but is a more collaborative effort.
