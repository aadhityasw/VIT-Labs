# Database Support in Node Red


Aim : To retrieve and store information from and to a local database with the help of Node-RED and design a form to receive entries to store into the database, and display it using the Node-red dashboard by using the concepts of IoT.


<br><br>

With the help of Node-RED we have taken an input data from a form and processed and stored it into a local database using Node Red and have put it to practical use. We have also designed an API view to retrieve all the data stored inside the local database.
