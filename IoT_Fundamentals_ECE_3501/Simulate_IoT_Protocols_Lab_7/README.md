# Simulate IoT Protocols

This lab is radically different from the usual ones, as we here deal with simulating the connection protocols that are usually used between IoT devices.

The simulators used here operate in a virtual environment, so refer to any installation of the Coojs Simulator to set up the environment required for this experiment.

<br><br>


Aim : To simulate the IoT Protocols : 6LoWPAN and CoAP using Contiki Operating System using a Cooja simulator to demonstrate the concepts of IoT.


<br><br>

With the help of Contiki and Cooja, we have made a simulation of the 6LoWPAN and CoAP protocols of IoT.
