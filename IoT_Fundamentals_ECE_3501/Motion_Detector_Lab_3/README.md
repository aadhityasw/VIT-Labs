# Motion Detector with Tinker CAD


Aim : To build a Smart Parking System with the help of Tinker CAD and concepts of IoT.


<br><br>

With the help of Tinker-Cad we have designed a circuit of a Smart Parking Lot, in which we have implemented three lots and used Arduino to recognise and note down if a Parking space is vacant or not, and this information can be used for various purposes depending on the situation.
