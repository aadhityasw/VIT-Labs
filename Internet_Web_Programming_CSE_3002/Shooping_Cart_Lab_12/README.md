# PHP - Sessions and Cookies (Lab 12)

Design an online shopping cart application for VMart using PHP. The home
page should have a form for getting username and password. If the
credentials are correct, start a session and forward to a catalogue page. The
catalogue page should display the item name, item availability and price
along with checkbox and textbox for selecting the items of choice and
entering the quantity. The submit button in catalogue page should forward
the request to a cart page that displays the list of items purchased and the
total cost. Perform session management to provide the user with the option
to add, update or remove the purchases from the catalogue which must be
reflected in the cart. Provide a sign-out link in cart page that terminates the
session.
