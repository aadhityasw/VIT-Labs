3. In 1999, India proposed a positional method for determining the outcome of an election
with Kvoters and N candidates. Each voter ranks the candidates in increasing order of
preference from 1 to N. All the voters should enter the choice of preferences for all the
candidates. This method assigns a score to each candidate which equals the sum of their
individual rankings recorded by every voter. The candidate with the highest sum wins.

Write PHP code for this scenario.
