            <h1>Madhya Pradesh</h1>
            <p>Madhya Pradesh, a large state in central India, retains landmarks from eras throughout 
                Indian history. Begun in the 10th century, its Hindu and Jain temples at Khajuraho are 
                renowned for their carvings of erotic scenes, most prominently Kandariya Mahadeva, 
                a temple with more than 800 sculptures. The eastern Bandhavgarh and Kanha national parks, 
                noted Bengal tiger sanctuaries, offer guided safaris.</p>
