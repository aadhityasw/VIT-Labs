# CSS Forms - Interactive Registration Portal (Lab 5)

In this lab we expand upon the work done in creating a registration form earlier, by designing varieties of interactive form designs which accomodate well with various websites.

A few features implemented here are :

* Set Autofocus for “Name”
* When the mouse is moved over the submit button, change the color of it.
* Set a focus color for all input types.
* For “telephone”,
* * All boxes should have 3 digits
* * When first box is entered with 3 digits, the focus should automatically point out the second and so on.
