# Internet & Web Programming - CSE3002

## Setup

The tech stack needed are `HTML`, `CSS`, `JS`, 'MySQL` and `PHP`. The first three do not require any setup procedure.

PHP can be installed by many means, but I recommend the use of XAMPP which comes with apache server and mysql and a gui interface to control these servers.
