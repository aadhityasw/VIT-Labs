# Calculus for Engineers - MAT1011

## Setup

The labs in this section require MATLAB software. There are other open source alternatives like octane, but the syntax might vary at times. All programs contained here are written in MATLAB.


## List of Programs

#### 1. Revision - Matrices


#### 2. [Lagrange Mean Value Theorem](./Lagrange_MVT_Lab_2)


#### 3. [Integration as Area under Curve](./Integration_AUC_Lab_3)


#### 4. [Maxima Minima](./Maxima_Minima_Lab_4)


#### 5. Laplace Transform


#### 6. Plotting Surfaces


#### 7. Evaluating maxima and minima for functions of several variables


#### 8. Lagrange Multiplier Method


#### 9. Volume Under Surface


#### 10. Triple integral for finding Volume of a solid region


#### 11. Evaluating integrals using cylindrical and Spherical coordinates


#### 12. EVALUATING GRADIENT, CURL AND DIVERGENCE


#### 13. Evaluating Line Integrals
