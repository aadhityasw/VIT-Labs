# Stepper Motor (Lab 8)


## 1. STEP Motor Simulation

Simulate the increment and decrement of a stepper motor by using numbers for incrementing and decrementing.

The code for this section is available in the form of an image, and the process of running is same as for the labs before.


**Note : Not sure if this code works :)**


## 2. Rotate Motor

Rotate stepper motor in 

* * Clockwise direction

* * Anticlockwise direction


Note : Refer to the PDF document for more information on the code, and refer to your own class on its implementation, as this is not a simulation, but a rather hardware based assignment.
