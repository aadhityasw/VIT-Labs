# Microprocessor and Interfacing - CSE2006


## Setup

These labs require the use of an `8086 MASM` compiler, and in order to simulate the actual 8086  architecture, we will use the `DOSBOX` application. 

The setup procedure for this might not be as simple as the other courses, because we would have to place the masm compiler files in a particular location, and also the individual program files also in a particular location so that they are accessible both inside dosbox and can be compiled by the masm compiler.

If you are using a Windows OS, then follow this [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFZ0czdVn8I) which demonstrates the setting up procedure. And in case you are using a MacOS device, then follow this [Article](https://medium.com/@axayjha/getting-started-with-masm-8086-assembly-c625478265d8) which explains the setting up of these both in a MacOS X environment. Both of these processes are similar with just a few minor changes.

Also feel free to follow any other tutorial if you find it simpler, and if you do find any add them here for others to use.

I would suggest the use of any code editors like `VS Code` or `Sublime` for programming, as they provide syntax highlighting and have intellisense features which simplify your coding process.
