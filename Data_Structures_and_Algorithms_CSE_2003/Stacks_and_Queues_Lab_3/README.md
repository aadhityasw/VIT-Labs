# Stacks and Queues (Lab 3)


### 1. [Balls in Containers](./container_balls.cpp)

A container is sealed at the bottom and opened at the top. Balls can be inserted and removed from the container when required. Suggest an appropriate data structure and write algorithm for inserting and removing the balls from the container.


### 2. [Big Bussiness Idea](./bussiness_idea.cpp)

Pavithra is browsing about the competition “Big Business Idea” in NDTV PROFIT. She has noted down all the topics and criteria about the competition. She forgot to note down deadline. She has pressed back button in her browser window to get back to the previously visited page. Help Pavithra by using appropriate data structure to retrieve the pages.


### 3. Postfix Notation

Consider the following infix notation
`(300+23)*(43-21)/(84+7)`
* Convert the above infix notation to its equivalent post fix form [code](./postfix_notation.cpp)
* Evaluate the obtained post fix notation using stack. [code](./postfix_eval.cpp)
Write appropriate implementation for the same.


### 4. [Palindrome with Stacks](./stack_palindrome.cpp)

Using stacks check whether a given string is palindrome.


### 5. [Decimal to Binary Convertion](./decimal_to_binary.cpp)

Using stacks, convert a given decimal number to binary number.


### 6. [College Counselling](./college_counselling.cpp)

The information of students is stored in the sorted ascending order of their ranks obtained in VITEE (admission test). The students are called for counselling according to their rank in VITEE. If a student finishes counselling, he can move out and the next student is called for counselling. Each student takes 5 min to finish the counselling. Write a program that will store the student details such as name and their rank and simulate the in and out scenario and display the total time taken for all students to complete the counselling procedure.


### 7. [Stutter](./stutter.cpp)

Write a method stutter that accepts a queue of Integers as a parameter and replaces every element of the queue with two copies of that element.
[1, 2, 3] becomes [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]


### 8. [Mirror](./mirror.cpp)

Write a method mirror that accepts a queue of Strings as a parameter and appends the queue's contents to itself in reverse order.
[a, b, c] becomes [a, b, c, c, b, a]
