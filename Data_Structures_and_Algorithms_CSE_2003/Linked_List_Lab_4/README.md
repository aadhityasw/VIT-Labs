# Linked List (Lab 4)


### 1. [Singly Linked List](./linked_list.cpp)

Write a program to reverse a given string using a singly linked list.


### 2. [Merge List](./merge_list.cpp)

You are given two linked lists A and B containing integers in ascending order. Assume the list contains 5 elements each. Develop a code to merge the two lists in descending order. Your code should also print the integers at positions 1, 3, 5, 7 in the final merged list.


### 3. [Self Adjusting List](./self_adjusting_list.cpp)

Write a code to implement a self-adjusting list. A self- adjusting list is like a regular list, except that all insertions are performed at the front with an additional property – for any element that is searched for in the list, if the element is present in the list, that element is shifted to the front of the list without changing the relative order of other items.


### 4. [Queue using Linked List](./queue.cpp)

Using a linked list implement a queue to perform the following.
* Step 1: En-queue ‘n’ integers into the queue.
* Step 2: De-queue till the first odd number is found.
* Step 3: Display the content of the queue


### 5. [Stack using Linked List](./stack.cpp)

Using a linked list implement a stack using which the following functions are performed.
* Step 1: Insert an input string S1
* Step 2: Insert another input string S2
* Step 3: pop the contents of the stack into output string S3
