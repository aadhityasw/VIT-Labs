# Sorting (Lab 6)



### 1. [String Sort](./string_sort.cpp)

Write a program to declare an array of characters and initialize it with characters of the word “VIT Chennai Campus“ and then sort it. Please recall that characters are integers (their ASCII codes) and can be compared just like integers.


### 2. [Sort Odd Indices](./odd_index_sort.cpp)

Let ‘A’ be an array of size ‘n’ and it contains ‘ n ’ numbers. Write a C program to sort only odd indices of the array A.  Assume that the indices of the array ‘A’ starts from 1.

For example, if A= `-1, 2, -2, -5, 4, 0` is an input to your algorithm then your algorithm should  give the following output `-2, 2, -1, -5, 4, 0`.


### 3. [Sorted List Insertion](./sorted_list_insertion_1.cpp)

Write two C programs ( using two techniques)  to insert ‘ k ’ new elements into a sorted list of size ‘ n ’ . Your program has to sort n+k elements .


### 4. [Merge Sort](./merge_sort.cpp)

Write a program for merge sort.


### 5. [Quick Sort](./quick_sort.cpp)

Write a program for Quick sort.
