# Arrays and Strings (Lab 1)


### 1. [Find Largest digit in a number](./Arrays_and_Strings_Lab_1/largest_digit.c)

Write a C language program to input number and find a largest digit in a given number and print it in word with appropriate message. (e.g. n=5273 - “SEVEN is largest”)


### 2. [Even Odd Array Split](./Arrays_and_Strings_Lab_1/array_split.c)

Write a C program to read n numbers in an array and split the array into two arrays even and odd such that the array even contains all the even numbers and other is odd. So the output will be— (e.g. Original array is 7,9,4,6,5,3,2,10,18 Odd array is 7,9,5,3 Even array is 4,6,2,10,18 ) 25.


### 3. [String Palindrome](./Arrays_and_Strings_Lab_1/string_palindrome.cpp)

Write a C language program to check whether the gven string is palindrome or not.


### 4. [String Sort](./Arrays_and_Strings_Lab_1/string_sort.cpp)

Write a program to declare an array of characters and initialize it with characters of the word
 “VIT Chennai Campus “and then sort it. Please recall that characters are integers (their ASCII codes) and can be compared just like integers.


### 5. [Partial Array Sort](./Arrays_and_Strings_Lab_1/partial_array_sort.cpp)

Let ‘A’ be an array of size ‘n’ and it contains ‘ n ’ numbers. Write a C program to sort only odd indices of the array A.  Assume that the indices of the array ‘A’ starts from 1. For example, if A= `-1, 2, -2, -5, 4, 0` is an input to your algorithm then your algorithm should  give the following output `-2, 2, -1, -5, 4, 0`.


### 6. [Sorted Array Insertion](./Arrays_and_Strings_Lab_1/sorted_array_insertion.cpp)

Write a C program to insert ‘ k ’ new elements into a sorted list of size ‘ n ’ . Your program has to sort n+k elements .
