# Data Structures and Algorithms - CSE2003


## Setup

Any Programming Language can be used along for this course, but the provided solutions would be in C++.
Any C++ compiler would work for this. 

Further if you want to also learn to use Docker or have prior experience with it, I do have a docker image with compilers for python, C++, and Java installed. The docker image can be pulled with the following command :
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/aadhityasw/competitive-programming:latest
```
In case you do not have prior experience with docker and want to learn more, do use some online tutorials to learn about `Containers`, `Docker`, and how they work before you head over installing docker.
